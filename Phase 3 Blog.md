# Mood's Median Test

## General Information
One way to test non-normally distributed data is by using the Mood's Median Test.  This is done by using the median of the data.  This test compares the medians
of two samples to determine to find out significant difference.  Mood's Median Test used when the data includes outliers (e.g., for salary information, most 
people earn between $20k and $130k but the data includes one or two that earn multi-millions per year causing a Mean value to be greatly affected by one or 
just a few data points).
