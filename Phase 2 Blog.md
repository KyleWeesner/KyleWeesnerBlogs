Exploring   unknowns can be exciting!  Sometimes!  In everyday life unconsciously we perform hypothesis testing on some level with decision making. For example, most peoples morning routine consists of brushing ones teeth.  This can be broken down into many outcomes such as if I don't there will be no difference in smell or my breath will be minty fresh.  By knowing past experiences, data, one can duduce that your breath will smell better after brushing than If you had skipped.  Hypothesis testing is crutial in data science for investigating ideas and being able to conclude with a defendable answer.  There are five main steps when hypothesis testing.

## 1. State the Null and Alternative Hypothesis

When first wanting to test an experimental hypothesis it is crutial to devolope a null and alternative hypothesis.  The null hypothesis is essential in preventing your experiment from becoming biased.  The null hypothesis is you base that you true until rejected.  The alternative hypothesis is for testing your variable in which you want to test.

### Generally seen as
- Ho: Null hypothesis no significant difference between variables
- Ha or H1: Alternative Hypothesis there is a significant difference between variables
  
## 2. Collect Data to Test Hypothesis
  
  To be able to test or make inferences about your hypothesis there must be sufficient and valid data. 
  
## 3. Perform the Proper Statistical Test

- Z Test, used when comparing a sample mean to a population mean when n>50 
- T Test, used when comparing two samples together
- ANOVA, used when comparing three or more goups
- Chi Square, used when comparing two categories in your data (observed vs expected)

## 4. Reject or Failed to Reject Null Hypothesis

## 5. Discuss Results
Presenting a summary of your data and the p-value.  Go back to the initial question and state the findings either failing to reject the null or rejecting the null.  By rejecting the null it is equavalent to accepting the alternative hypothesis.
