Exploring   unknowns can be exciting!  Sometimes!  In everyday life unconsciously we perform hypothesis testing on some level with decision making.  For example, most peoples morning routine consists of brushing ones teeth.  This can be broken down into many outcomes such as if I don't there will be no difference in smell or my breath will be minty fresh.  By knowing past experiences, data, one can duduce that your breath will smell better after brushing than If you had skipped.  Hypothesis testing is crutial in data science for investigating ideas and being able to conclude with a defendable answer.  There are five main steps when hypothesis testing.

## 1. State the Null and Alternative Hypothesis

When first wanting to test an experimental hypothesis it is crutial to devolope a null and alternative hypothesis.  The null hypothesis is essential in preventing your experiment from becoming biased.

### Types of Hypothesis 
- Ho: Null hypothesis no significant difference between variables
- Ha: Alternative Hypothesis there is a significant difference between variables
## 2. Collect Data to Test Hypothesis

## 3. Perform the Proper Statistical Test

- Z Test
- T Test
- ANOVA
- Chi Square

## 4. Reject or Fail to Reject Null Hypothesis

## 5. Discuss Results
