By exploring large amounts of data it can enable data scientist to make practical predictions to lead to effective decisions based on the market.  There are many ways gaming companies may collect information about their customers to better appeal towards them.  Many features of the customers are explored such as location and age of the customers.  By knowing information about the majority of the customers it helps narrow down where advertising should be allocated.  By advertising on the right platforms this can increase the activity of current users and at the same time hopefully gain new ones in the process.  Data scientists can use machine learning algorithms to access potential values in these customer groups and at the same time find which platforms and products will most likely appeal towards them.  

## Social and Customer Analytics
This area is similar to that of personalized marketing in analyzing customers data to make predictions, but this area is more focused on using data to make predictions on making the ideal consumer groups which the product will most likely appeal to them.

Gaming companies want customer information, their in game resources, and any losses that may affect the customer and business.  If companies do not have good protection this will diminish activity in the game.  Data scientists are helpful in making fraud detecting models to help identify possible scammers.  Having models that are able to identify suspicious activity will help in this sector.  They are needed to be automated and handle large quantity of data to effectively assist.


## E-sports
