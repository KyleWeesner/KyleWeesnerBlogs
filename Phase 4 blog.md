When developing a game, insights from beta deployments and similar prior commercial endeavors can help optimize aspects of that game.  Data scientists have the ability to build models to predict and analyze data through the use of machine learning.  This data can be collected in many ways and the knowledge gained after analyzing the data can be used to optimize what the target audience may prefer.

## Game Monetization

Data scientists look at market demographics, spending habits, competition in the genre, and other factors to develop more effective go to market plans for their game.  There are more ways for games to make money outside of software/hardware purchases such as games being free to play, pay to play , and freemium.  By using different subscription models games can earn revenue in different manners.
